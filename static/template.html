		<header><h1>Cricket Batsmen Standard Deviation</h1></header>

		<p>The table on this page lists the top 200 best male test cricket batsmen based on total number of runs scored. They've been analysed according to a version of the script you can find in <a href="">this notebook</a> which was made to accompany <a href="http://mattallinson.com/2018/11/12/cricketing-deviants/">this blog post on the standard deviation of cricket averages</a>. As well as coming up with standard deviations, I also come up with two extra, slightly O.T.T. cricketing metrics, which are explained below.</p>


		<p><h2>What the new terms mean</h2></p><p>
		$$reliability = {\text{average} \over \text{standard deviation}}$$
		$$dependableness = \text{reliability} \times \text{average} = {\text{average}^2 \over \text{standard deviation}}$$
		</p>

		<p>Click headings to sort by that column.<a href="top200_batsmen.csv">Download the data</a> as a .csv (right click and save file).</p>
