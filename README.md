```sitemaker.py``` is a script that scrapes Cricinfo for the runs of the top 200 highest scoring batsmen of all time, then calculates their standard deviations, then publishes this as a csv and an html file. 

Made to accompany [this blog post](http://mattallinson.com/2018/11/12/cricketing-deviants/). 

In the future I may separate out the "Batsman" python class into a separate library and rejig evereything as opposed to have all the scripts in one sprawling file.
